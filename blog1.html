        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p class="bcontent">Hello ! this is a random day in my life. My life has been rough lately.Headache stamping into my brain ,about to crack open my skull as i pin these words. My head is stuffed full of cotton , everything foggy and clouded. i really need to grab a canvas and some brushes,get my mind off everything , and just loose myself into the colourful paint.</p>

        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p class="bcontent"> The importance of art is an important topic and has been debated for many years. Some might think art is not considered as important as science or technology. Some might ask what art is able to offer the world  or perhaps how can art change us and the world. Art for me is something which makes me feel at peace ,my go to place when i feel nervous or depressed.The greatest aspect of learning or practicing art is to look at things with a complete different vision. It helps us to view things with varied perspectives which eventually helps us to solve our daily life problems leaving us with creative solutions. Art makes life more manageable, tolerable and enjoyable. Art does not need to explain in words how someone feels â€“ it only shows.Art becomes a universal language for all of us to tell our stories; it is the ultimate storyteller. It is a universal language ;it crosses all the language culture barriers.It could be used in a theraputic way or it can be used as powerful political tool or expressing our emotions ,it could be used to share a story or could also be used as decorative beautiful piece to showcase and feel good about it.Art is important because it gives us the power to mold and shape our lives and experiences. <br>

                  <strong>Art styles i have tried</strong> <br>
                  <br>I love exploring the world of colourful and theraputic artsy stuff. I have had my hands on  different art mediums I have explored watercolour ,gouache and acrylic medium so far. Making a huge canvas painting is exciting and tiring at the same time. The amount of patience required depends on the size and complications of the painting. For me goauche medium is the one which makes my job easier and watercolour medium is somehow a bit challenging to me. As a child i have always used watercolours throughout school life. But as I started practising new mediums I somehow lost touch with the old yet vibrant watercolours. People generally find acrylic colours a bit challenging due to their ability of quick drying. After the acrylic paint gets dried out we cannot use it again as water or gouache.<br> I have also tried making clay idols and the process is really enjoyable. With that keeping a scrapbook or making explosion greetings is what i love the most.Using colourful papers and carefully stacking each pastels and floral prints with polaroid pictures ,writing a small handwritten note and voila our personalised handmade card is ready ! I love creating our everyday dry waste into something beautiful and sometimes useful. I made a lot of DIY stuff to start with i made a brush stand with a jar of sweets, a water-bottle planter, a wine bottle chime , an oil can into a boho piece. I absolutely love playing around with colours, making dull looking stuff into bright lively pieces,creating and gifting memories in the form of art.For me art is where i find the joy of living!

        <h3>About Artists</h3>
        <p>An artist is a person whose mind is like a sea with lots of dreams, colours, inventions and imaginations. If you have ever talked to an artist, you will know in which world they live in.

            They may be an introvert but the mindset which they have is of a dreamer, who dreams of flying as high as possible.
            When they hold a paint brush, they are no more a person who only paints, but they are the one's who paint a masterpiece. Most of the famous artists never wanted to paint only for money, they wanted to showcase their talent because they wanted to inspire others. So when you aim to become an artist, never do it just because you want to earn, but do it because you want to make people awestruck.</p>
